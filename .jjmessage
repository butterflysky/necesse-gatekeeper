Switch whitelist persistence to JSON; update tests and docs

- Replace whitelist.txt with whitelist.json (enabled, lockdown, auth array).
- Implement Gson load/save in WhitelistManager (pretty-printed JSON).
- Update WhitelistManagerTest to expect JSON format and filename.
- Update README.md and WORKSHOP.md to document JSON location/format.
- No backward support for text format per project direction.
- Per-world paths and audit logs remain unchanged.
